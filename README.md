## Tensorflow Element Detection

This short video is a demonstration of a TensorFlow object detection and position calculation program. Using a tensorflow model to identify the yellow blocks, we developed the inverse kinematic model to find the robotâ€™s relative location to the cubes and then plot a trajectory to align in front of the blocks. This system was to be integrated into the driver-controlled section of the Rover Ruckus 2018-2019 robot to provide automation to assist cycle efficiency, but did not work as accurately as needed for competitions.
